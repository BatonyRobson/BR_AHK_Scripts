# My Useful AutoHotKey Scripts

To use any AHK script you need to download software itself from developers official site: https://www.autohotkey.com/

Scroll Wheel As Arrows

Problem: multiple presses of arrow keys in a row is unconvinient and feels like crap in your fingers.

Solution:

1) hold caps lock to make scroll wheel pressing left and right arrows 
2) press caps lock + control to actually toggle Capslock
3) hold right control to make scroll wheel press left and right arrows + control
4) same applies to right alt and right shift
5) hold scroll lock to make scroll wheel pressing up and down arrows
6) press shift + scroll lock to toggle scroll lock (for some reason i cant make it work with control)

Usecases:

1) quickly move text cursor in any text input field (and selecting it with RShift)
2) quickly scroll video frame by frame in MPC (RCtrl) or another video player that allows frame-by-frame viewing with arrow keys 
3) move clips in premiere (RAlt)
4) move time cursor in premiere in sequence window (not just in source of program window)
5) quickly scroll through photos in windows default viewer or any viewer that doesn't allow you to use scroll wheel for it
6) move layers in photoshop (with move tool selected)
7) any other possible case where you need to press arrows rapidly many times in a row (where AHK is working)
